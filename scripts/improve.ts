// The agent reads what went wrong in a run and rewrites its own instructions and skill.
//   1. Takes the run's failed tasks (never the holdout ones) with the scorer's feedback.
//   2. Opens a TrueForge session with the agent itself (or, with --coach, an inline coach agent on the same model)
//      and asks it for new versions of agent/instructions.md and agent/skills/*/SKILL.md.
//   3. Writes the files and commits them with the trailer "Agent-Session: <session_id>".
// You review the commit (git show) and keep it or drop it (git reset --hard HEAD~1). You don't edit it.

const prompt = `This message is not a code review. Ignore the Output section of your instructions for this reply.

You are improving your own playbook. Below are your current instruction files, then the reviews you got wrong in your last evaluation run, with what the scorer said.

Rewrite your files so that next time you catch the kinds of problems you missed and stop making the kinds of comments that were not real problems.

Rules:
- Write general rules that would help on code you have never seen. Never mention these files, file names, task names, function names or line numbers.
- Keep what works. Change only what the failures show is wrong or missing. Keep the Output section of instructions.md exactly as it is: the scorer depends on it.
- Short beats long: a checklist item is one line, with what to look for.
- You may edit agent/instructions.md and any agent/skills/<name>/SKILL.md (keep the frontmatter). Leave out files you don't change.

Reply with each changed file in full, in this format, and nothing else:

<<<FILE agent/skills/review-checklist/SKILL.md
(the whole new file)
>>>
<<<LEARNED
(one sentence: what you learned)
>>>

## Your current files

${currentFiles.map((f) => `<<<FILE ${f.path}\n${f.text.trim()}\n>>>`).join("\n\n")}

## What went wrong in run ${nn}

${feedback}
